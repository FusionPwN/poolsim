GAMELOGIC PARAMETERS

- There should be 16 balls in total, comprising a white cue ball, seven striped balls, seven solid balls, and one black ball (8 ball)
- A coin is tossed to decide who gets to break
- The first player to pot an object ball will then have to continue to pot the balls from that category (stripes or solids). The opposition player will have to pot the other group
- During the break if the 8 ball is potted the game restarts
- A player will continue to make shots until they foul, or fail to pot an object ball. Then it is the turn of the opposing player. Play continues like this for the remainder of the game.
- When the previous player commits a foul and it's a cue ball in hand then the next player should have a higher chance of scoring
- There should be reasons for misses and fouls
- Log each action being simulated
- Multiple balls can be potted in one play, small chance depending on the player skill level, the potted balls can be owned by the opponent so this is a simulated accident
- On the break a player might not be able to pot a ball
- When potting the 8 ball, if the player also pots the cue ball or shoots it off the table he should lose the game
- Potting an opponents ball is not a foul unless you hit the opponents ball first

- Failing to hit your own object balls. (can happen any time a player tries to pot a ball)
